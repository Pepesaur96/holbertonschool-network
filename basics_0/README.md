# OSI Model

- The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunications or networking system into seven distinct layers. It helps in understanding how different networking protocols and technologies work together.

## What it is

The OSI model is a reference model that provides a structured way to understand and design network communication systems.

## How many layers it has

The OSI model consists of seven layers.

## How it is organized

The OSI model is organized into seven layers, each responsible for specific functions, from physical transmission to application-level services. These layers, from bottom to top, are:

- Physical
- Data Link
- Network
- Transport
- Session
- Presentation
- Application

# What is a LAN

A LAN (Local Area Network) is a network that covers a small geographic area, like a home, office, or campus. It connects computers and devices in a close proximity, typically within a single building.

## Typical usage

LANs are used for local communication, resource sharing, and data exchange among devices within the same physical location.

## Typical geographical size

LANs typically cover a small area, ranging from a room to a few kilometers.

# What is a WAN

A WAN (Wide Area Network) is a network that spans a large geographic area, often a city, country, or even the entire world. It connects LANs and other networks across long distances.

## Typical usage

WANs are used to connect remote offices, data centers, and individual LANs across different locations.

## Typical geographical size

WANs can cover large and sometimes global distances, depending on the specific network infrastructure and technology used.

# What is the Internet

The Internet is a global network of interconnected computer networks that use the TCP/IP protocol suite to communicate. It is a vast network that enables the exchange of information, services, and resources worldwide.

## What is an IP address

An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It serves two main functions: identifying the host or network interface and providing the location of the host in the network.

## What are the 2 types of IP address

There are two types of IP addresses: IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) and IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6). IPv4 uses a 32-bit address format, while IPv6 uses a 128-bit address format.

## What is localhost

"Localhost" refers to the loopback address 127.0.0.1 in IPv4, or "::1" in IPv6. It is used to establish network connections to the device itself, allowing a computer to communicate with its own services.

## What is a subnet

A subnet is a portion of a larger network that is logically separated. Subnetting allows for efficient IP address management and network organization.

## Why IPv6 was created

IPv6 was created to address the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses. It provides a much larger address space, improved security features, and better support for modern networking requirements.

# TCP/UDP

- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are two of the main protocols of the TCP/IP protocol suite. They are used to send data packets over the Internet and other networks.

## What are the 2 mainly used data transfer protocols for IP (transfer level on the OSI schema)

The two mainly used data transfer protocols for IP are TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).

## What is the main difference between TCP and UDP

The main difference is that TCP is connection-oriented and provides reliable, error-checked data delivery, while UDP is connectionless and offers faster, but potentially less reliable, data transmission.

## What is a port

A port is a software-based endpoint through which data is sent and received on a computer or device. Ports are used to distinguish different services or processes on the same device.

## Memorize SSH, HTTP and HTTPS port numbers

- SSH (Secure Shell): Port 22
- HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): Port 80
- HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure): Port 443

## What tool/protocol is often used to check if a device is connected to a network

The most common tool/protocol used to check if a device is connected to a network is ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol), often utilized through the "ping" command. "Ping" sends ICMP echo requests to a target device and waits for a response to determine if the device is reachable.
